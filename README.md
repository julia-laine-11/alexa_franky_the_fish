# alexa_franky_the_fish
I made this with my dad for fun over a break during school. I had this fish laying around and someone gave me an old Alexa.


The code is super basic. It just waits for an Analog signal from the Alexa's lights so it can tell a relay to turn on and off and power the fish's jaws.

Enjoy!
